## List of Capstone Projects

* **Find PI to the Nth Digit** - Enter a number and have the program generate π (pi) up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

* **Find e to the Nth Digit** - Just like the previous problem, but with e instead of π (pi). Enter a number and have the program generate e up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

* **Fibonacci Sequence** - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.

* **Prime Factorization** - Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.

* **Next Prime Number** - Have the program find prime numbers until the user chooses to stop asking for the next one.
